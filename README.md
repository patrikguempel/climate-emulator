# Climate Emulators based on the ClimSim dataset
The 'thesis' directory provides an overview over the training code of every model mentioned in the thesis, together with the evaluation scores and model files if storage limitations allow it. 
The code used for training the ClimSim baseline models is taken in large parts from the ClimSim repository: https://github.com/leap-stc/ClimSim

Note that the dataset and its training/validation subsets are not included in the repository, due to GitHubs file size limitations. Same applies to the XGBoost model files.
